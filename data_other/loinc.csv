In the confirmatory assay, a second dRVVT is performed using a reagent with additional phospholipids capable of neutralizing the LA. A ratio of the clotting times is calculated from the dRVVT screening test divided by the dRVVT confirmatory test. If a LA is present, the dRVVT confirmatory test will correct to normal. The dRVVT confirmatory reagent also contains a neutralizing agent for heparin in concentrations up to 1 unit/mL. Although patients on Coumadin or patients with deficiencies of factor II, V, and X may show prolonged times, the final ratio will be normal unless a LA is present. The dRVVT confirmatory assay should be run only if the dRVVT screening assay is elevated above the normal reference interval. In thei case, the confirmatory test is done and a ratio is calculated. If the ratio is greater than the upper limit of the established normal reference interval, the LA is present. If the ratio is less than or equal to the upper limit, the LA is absent. The dRVVT screen to confirm ratio formula is based on the 2009 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis lupus anticoagulant testing guidelines.

This in vitro assay uses citrated whole blood in the point of care or laboratory setting.  Not for use in patients with underlying congenital platelet abnormalities, patients with non-aspirin induced acquired platelet abnormalities or in patients receiving non-aspirin platelet agents (may be used in patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors, e.g., (Celebrex(r))).    The VerifyNow assay incorporates the agonist arachidonic acid to activate platelets, and measures platelet function based upon the ability of activated platelets to bind fibrinogen.  Fibrinogen-coated microparticles aggregate in whole blood in proportion to the number of unblocked platelets GP IIb/IIIa receptors.  Light transmittance increases in as activated platelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen-coated beads.  The instrument measures this change in optical signal caused by aggregation.

In the confirmatory assay, a second dRVVT is performed using a reagent with additional phospholipids capable of neutralizing the LA. A ratio of the clotting times is calculated from the dRVVT screening test divided by the dRVVT confirmatory test. If a LA is present, the dRVVT confirmatory test will correct to normal. The dRVVT confirmatory reagent also contains a neutralizing agent for heparin in concentrations up to 1 unit/mL. Although patients on Coumadin or patients with deficiencies of factor II, V, and X may show prolonged times, the final ratio will be normal unless a LA is present. The dRVVT confirmatory assay should be run only if the dRVVT screening assay is elevated above the normal reference interval. In thei case, the confirmatory test is done and a ratio is calculated. If the ratio is greater than the upper limit of the established normal reference interval, the LA is present. If the ratio is less than or equal to the upper limit, the LA is absent. The dRVVT screen to confirm ratio formula is based on the 2009 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis lupus anticoagulant testing guidelines.

There are different types of challenges. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation, where cosyntropin (a synthetic form of ACTH) is given, and then blood is sampled for cortisol levels before the bolus, and at specified times after the bolus. The ACTH stimulation directly evaluates adrenal gland function and indirectly evaluates pituitary gland and hypothalamus function. Cortisol levels rise significantly after administration of cosyntropin if the adrenal glands are functioning normally. For the CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation, CRH is given and cortisol and ACTH levels are determined before the injection, at the injection time, and specified times following injection. The CRH stimulation test is used to distinguish Cushings disease from conditions where ACTH is secreted ectopically. For the Dexamethasone suppression (overnight) test (DST), dexamethasone (Decadron) is given and samples for cortisol levels are collected the following morning. The DST differentiates the causes of increased cortisol levels. For the Metyrapone (overnight) stimulation challenge, metyrapone is given with a snack at midnight. Samples for cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and ACTH are collected the following morning. The metyrapone stimulation test distinguishes corticotropin-dependent causes (pituitary Cushing's disease and ectopic Cushing's disease) from corticotropin-independent causes (carcinoma of the lung or thyroid) of increased cortisol levels.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","","17-Hydroxycorticosterone; 4h p chal; After; CHEMISTRY.CHALLENGE TESTING; Compound F; Coritsol; Cort; F; hydrocortisone; Level; p chal; Pl; Plasma; Plsm; Point in time; PST; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; SerP; SerPl; SerPlas; Serum; Serum or plasma; SR; Substance concentration","Cortis 4h p chal SerPl-sCnc","Observation","","","","nmol/L","Cortisol [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma --4 hours post XXX challenge","","nmol/L","","","","","0","0","0","","","","","","2.52","","Cortisol 4 Hr post Unsp challenge [Moles/Vol]","7543","77930-6","COR240"

There are different types of challenges. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation, where cosyntropin (a synthetic form of ACTH) is given, and then blood is sampled for cortisol levels before the bolus, and at specified times after the bolus. The ACTH stimulation directly evaluates adrenal gland function and indirectly evaluates pituitary gland and hypothalamus function. Cortisol levels rise significantly after administration of cosyntropin if the adrenal glands are functioning normally. For the CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation, CRH is given and cortisol and ACTH levels are determined before the injection, at the injection time, and specified times following injection. The CRH stimulation test is used to distinguish Cushings disease from conditions where ACTH is secreted ectopically. For the Dexamethasone suppression (overnight) test (DST), dexamethasone (Decadron) is given and samples for cortisol levels are collected the following morning. The DST differentiates the causes of increased cortisol levels. For the Metyrapone (overnight) stimulation challenge, metyrapone is given with a snack at midnight. Samples for cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and ACTH are collected the following morning. The metyrapone stimulation test distinguishes corticotropin-dependent causes (pituitary Cushing's disease and ectopic Cushing's disease) from corticotropin-independent causes (carcinoma of the lung or thyroid) of increased cortisol levels.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","","17-Hydroxycorticosterone; 4h p chal; After; CHEMISTRY.CHALLENGE TESTING; Compound F; Coritsol; Cort; F; hydrocortisone; Level; p chal; Pl; Plasma; Plsm; Point in time; PST; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; SerP; SerPl; SerPlas; Serum; Serum or plasma; SR; Substance concentration","Cortis 4h p chal SerPl-sCnc","Observation","","","","nmol/L","Cortisol [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma --4 hours post XXX challenge","","nmol/L","","","","","0","0","0","","","","","","2.52","","Cortisol 4 Hr post Unsp challenge [Moles/Vol]","137475","77930-6","COR240#"

There are different types of challenges. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation, where cosyntropin (a synthetic form of ACTH) is given, and then blood is sampled for cortisol levels before the bolus, and at specified times after the bolus. The ACTH stimulation directly evaluates adrenal gland function and indirectly evaluates pituitary gland and hypothalamus function. Cortisol levels rise significantly after administration of cosyntropin if the adrenal glands are functioning normally. For the CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation, CRH is given and cortisol and ACTH levels are determined before the injection, at the injection time, and specified times following injection. The CRH stimulation test is used to distinguish Cushings disease from conditions where ACTH is secreted ectopically. For the Dexamethasone suppression (overnight) test (DST), dexamethasone (Decadron) is given and samples for cortisol levels are collected the following morning. The DST differentiates the causes of increased cortisol levels. For the Metyrapone (overnight) stimulation challenge, metyrapone is given with a snack at midnight. Samples for cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and ACTH are collected the following morning. The metyrapone stimulation test distinguishes corticotropin-dependent causes (pituitary Cushing's disease and ectopic Cushing's disease) from corticotropin-independent causes (carcinoma of the lung or thyroid) of increased cortisol levels.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","","17-Hydroxycorticosterone; 4h p chal; After; CHEMISTRY.CHALLENGE TESTING; Compound F; Coritsol; Cort; F; hydrocortisone; Level; p chal; Pl; Plasma; Plsm; Point in time; PST; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; SerP; SerPl; SerPlas; Serum; Serum or plasma; SR; Substance concentration","Cortis 4h p chal SerPl-sCnc","Observation","","","","nmol/L","Cortisol [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma --4 hours post XXX challenge","","nmol/L","","","","","0","0","0","","","","","","2.52","","Cortisol 4 Hr post Unsp challenge [Moles/Vol]","172503","77930-6","C-SG-CORT240-01"

There are different types of challenges. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation, where cosyntropin (a synthetic form of ACTH) is given, and then blood is sampled for cortisol levels before the bolus, and at specified times after the bolus. The ACTH stimulation directly evaluates adrenal gland function and indirectly evaluates pituitary gland and hypothalamus function. Cortisol levels rise significantly after administration of cosyntropin if the adrenal glands are functioning normally. For the CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) stimulation, CRH is given and cortisol and ACTH levels are determined before the injection, at the injection time, and specified times following injection. The CRH stimulation test is used to distinguish Cushings disease from conditions where ACTH is secreted ectopically. For the Dexamethasone suppression (overnight) test (DST), dexamethasone (Decadron) is given and samples for cortisol levels are collected the following morning. The DST differentiates the causes of increased cortisol levels. For the Metyrapone (overnight) stimulation challenge, metyrapone is given with a snack at midnight. Samples for cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and ACTH are collected the following morning. The metyrapone stimulation test distinguishes corticotropin-dependent causes (pituitary Cushing's disease and ectopic Cushing's disease) from corticotropin-independent causes (carcinoma of the lung or thyroid) of increased cortisol levels.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","","17-Hydroxycorticosterone; 4h p chal; After; CHEMISTRY.CHALLENGE TESTING; Compound F; Coritsol; Cort; F; hydrocortisone; Level; p chal; Pl; Plasma; Plsm; Point in time; PST; QNT; Quan; Quant; Quantitative; Random; SerP; SerPl; SerPlas; Serum; Serum or plasma; SR; Substance concentration","Cortis 4h p chal SerPl-sCnc","Observation","","","","nmol/L","Cortisol [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma --4 hours post XXX challenge","","nmol/L","","","","","0","0","0","","","","","","2.52","","Cortisol 4 Hr post Unsp challenge [Moles/Vol]","176340","77930-6","C-SG-CORT240#-01"

Cells are spun and, using the ficoll centrifugation procedure, the polys and RBCs layer together in the bottom fraction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the middle. The PBMCs are pipetted out to yield about 250,000 PBMCs per aliquot. They are incubated with M. tuberculosis specific antigens (ESAT-6, CFP10) in two separate wells, a phytohemagglutinin (PHA) control (a mitogenic stimulator) in another well, and a negative control in a fourth well.  Incubation with the antigens allows for stimulation of any sensitized T cells present. Evaluating the number of antigen incubated spots compared to the positive and negative control spots provides a measurement of the abundance of M. tuberculosis sensitive T cells in the patient's blood.","ACTIVE","","1","","","","","","","Acid Fast; Acid Fast Bacilli; Acid fast bacillus; AFB; Blood; ELISPOT; ID; IFN; IGRA; Infectious Disease; InfectiousDisease; M tb; M TB IFN-g; M TB IFN-g+spot Pnl; M tuberculosis; Microbiology; Mtb; Myco; Mycobact; Mycobacterium tuberculosum; Pan; PANEL.MICROBIOLOGY; Panl; Pnl; Point in time; Random; TB; T-SPOT; T-SPOT.TB; Tuberculosis; WB; Whole blood","M TB IFN-g+spot Pnl Bld","Order","","","","","Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulated gamma interferon and spot count panel - Blood","","","","","","","0","0","0","","","Panel","","","2.46","","M. tuberculosis stim IFN-g and spot count panel (Bld)","178032","74281-7","C-PH-TPSP-01"
